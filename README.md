<h2> Hey There! üëãüèª </h2>
I'm always curious about what makes great software great and enjoy digging into how things work. I have a knack for building scalable and efficient solutions that solve real-world problems.

In my free time, I dive into engineering blogs from tech companies to learn how they design, scale, and optimize their systems to tackle complex challenges. I also enjoy competitive programming and regularly participate in contests.

If you're looking for someone passionate about designing and building impactful software systems, feel free to connect with me!
